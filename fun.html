            Spiders are the worlds smallest hunters.
            Furthermore, what they hunt does not include 'you'.
            What they hunt depends upon the specific family they belong to.
            There are many factors that differentiate the families, including
            as fundamental a process as the production of silk, that is, how
            it's produced & what it contains. Some process their silk after it's
            produced for an added affect that improves their chances of catching 
            prey.
